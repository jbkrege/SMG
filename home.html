      <b>Abstract</b><br><br>
      &emsp; All perceived music and sound can be viewed as a compilation of atomic sound particles.
        Granular synthesis is a method of composition and music production that allows manipulation of sound particles 10ms-1sec long, called “grains,” to create sound textures and time stretches.
        The issue with current technology is that variability is gained only through randomizing a widely accepted group of parameters: arrangement, size and frequency of grains, and pitch.
        A method of selecting grains more intelligently could provide more control over the texture than available technology.
        Our innovation is to use a similarity matrix to choose grains that are similar to previous ones played.
